The starting code is based on the work of the [OpenGL series](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLlrATfBNZ98foTJPJ_Ev03o2oq3-GGOS2 "OpenGL Playlist") by [Cherno](https://github.com/TheCherno "Cherno GitHub").
The current repo structure is fairly simple:
- `res` folder contains shader source files and texture files
- `src/core` folder contains the main code needed to create a simple application
- `src/deps` folder contains all the external dependencies (libraries, headers, ...) needed for building an application
- `src/tests` folder contains personal experiments to test graphics concepts
